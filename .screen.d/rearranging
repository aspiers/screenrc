# Used to use this for quick reordering of windows before writing my patch
# *Note: Input Translation in screen info for correct -k sequences:
#     -k k;    F10
#     -k F1    F11
#     -k F2    F12
bindkey -k k; eval colon 'stuff "number "'

# Move window left/right.  This only works with my patch
# to screen's process.c file.
# Could have used M-left/M-right:
#bindkey "[C" number +1
#bindkey "[D" number -1
# but let's save them for a more common operation, and use
# C-s-PageUp/Down Ã  la firefox.
bindkey "[5@" number -1
bindkey "[6@" number +1
