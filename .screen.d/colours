# See ~/org/notes/Terminals.org::*colours

# New strategy: don't set terminal type here at all, because it
# would be a layer boundary violation, by assuming knowledge about
# the terminal in which screen is running.

# We previously choose the third option from the strategies listed:
#term rxvt-256color

# However this breaks left/right cursor keys in less(1) on openSUSE 12.1 :-(
# Fixable via: TERM=screen 

# This one is too long (really? what did I mean by that?):
#screen-256color-bce-s

# for some reason this one only yields 8 colours:
#term screen-256color-bce
