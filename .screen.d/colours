# rxvt is normally 88-color-capable unless patched to 256.  This can
# be seen by running my tty-colors script (which isn't affected by
# $TERM w.r.t. the number of colours).
#
# OTOH emacs *does* rely on $TERM to figure out the right colour map.
# Similarly screen looks at the value of $TERM when launched to determine
# its behaviour.
#
# TERM=rxvt-unicode does the right thing outside screen - generally it
# will signal 88 colours to emacs (test with M-x list-colors-display).

#term rxvt-unicode

# However, screen automatically maps the 88 colours to a 256 colour
# palette, so that apps running inside screen need to believe they
# have 256, and then used colours get flattened back onto the 88
# colour palette.  This can be seen by running my tty-colors script
# inside and outside screen and comparing the results.
#
# So the working combinations are:
#
# (1) TERM=rxvt-256color when launching screen and
#     TERM=rxvt-unicode when launching emacs inside screen
#
#     Here screen thinks we have 256 colours but only the first 88 are
#     non-black.  emacs only uses the first 88.
#
#
# (2) TERM=rxvt-256color when launching screen and
#     TERM=rxvt-256color when launching emacs inside screen
#
#     Here screen thinks we have 256 colours but only the first 88 are
#     non-black.  emacs sees all 256 but only uses the first 88.
#
# (3) TERM=rxvt-unicode when launching screen and
#     TERM=rxvt-256color when launching emacs inside screen
#
#     Here screen stretches the 88 colours across the 256 colour space,
#     and emacs uses them all.
#
# The third option is best because it doesn't require changing TERM
# outside screen:

term rxvt-256color

# This one is too long:
#screen-256color-bce-s

# for some reason this one only yields 8 colours:
#term screen-256color-bce
