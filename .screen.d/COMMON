# This is how one can set a reattach password:
# password ODSJQf.4IJN7E    # "1234"

# emulate .logout message
pow_detach_msg "Screen session of \$LOGNAME \$:cr:\$:nl:ended."

# Make shell "sticky" - bypass shell switching mechanism if it's in use
shell $SHELL

# C-a is too useful to rebind as a prefix.  This is actually two
# "characters", the first being ^\, and the second \\.
defescape ^\\\
escape ^\\\

# Imbeciles!!!!
msgwait 1
# might need this one too
msgminwait 1

# Bind delete to ^?.  kD is termcap-speak for delete (-k uses termcap-speak)
bindkey -k kD stuff "\177"

# Notes about keybindings:
#
# F1 is used by Eterm, leave F2-F7 on LHS of Kinesis keyboard for
# per-app bindings.
# 
# Bindings using eval should ideally go last since they don't work on
# older screens and we want all other settings to always take effect.
