# Commented out, because as it turns out, ensuring TERM=Eterm
# will work nicer than the above hack.  Here's an 
# explanation of what it does anyway:
#
# \E[? is for DEC private modes.  1 is for Application/Normal
# cursor keys, and l does a DECRST.  \E= sets Application Keypad
# (\E> sets Normal Keypad).  Setting the ks capability to this
# ensures that Eterm never switches to application mode.  We
# want normal mode, since in normal mode, Eterm distinguishes
# between left and S-left:

# S-left/S-right in Eterm changes windows.
