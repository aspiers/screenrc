# Commented out, because as it turns out, ensuring TERM=Eterm
# will work nicer than the above hack.  Here's an 
# explanation of what it does anyway:
#
# \E[? is for DEC private modes.  1 is for Application/Normal
# cursor keys, and l does a DECRST.  \E= sets Application Keypad
# (\E> sets Normal Keypad).  Setting the ks capability to this
# ensures that Eterm never switches to application mode.  We
# want normal mode, since in normal mode, Eterm distinguishes
# between left and S-left:
#   http://www.eterm.org/docs/view.php?doc=ref#keys

# S-left/S-right in Eterm changes windows.
bindkey "[c" next
bindkey "[d" prev

# S-left/S-right in xterm changes windows.
bindkey "[1;2C" next
bindkey "[1;2D" prev

# For split regions, bind C-\ j/k to up/down between regions
bind j focus down
bind k focus up
