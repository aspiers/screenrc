- When binding, can only use commands from the "current" mode
  which you're binding to, e.g. 'page-up' is only valid with
  -t vi-copy or -t emacs-copy, and 'send-keys' is only valid
  in global binding context (i.e. without -t).

- Can't bind multiple commands inside copy-mode.

  - Instead, you have to add global bindings for the commands,
    to source scripts, which can contain normal commands in global
    context (send-keys etc.)

  - In order to execute copy-mode actions from the global bindings,
    you have to rebind the copy-mode actions to a temporary key K,
    then send-keys K to execute the action.

  - source-file can be chained.

Yuk!
